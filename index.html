    Homework 1: on the syllabus and video
  </h1>
  <h2>
    Introduction
  </h2>
  <p>
    In both the video and the syllabus, there is an obvious emphasis on teamwork. In particular, 
    Mayuko talks about how "soft skills” were often the key factor to whether a co-worker was a good person to work with. 
    She talked about how it is much easier to teach someone a technical skill, such as a nuance in a programming language, 
    than it is to teach them how to communicate effectively as a team member. As such, it is important to develop those
     soft skills early on, and this class has a clear focus on teamwork.

    Soft Skills

    Teamwork in CSC 160 is most prominent in the fact that most everything we do is with a partner. This includes daily labs, 
    larger projects, and even the grading is on a peer-to-peer basis. In the video, Mayuko talks about how it’s important to be able 
    to work with people who have all kinds of different skill sets, and that it might even be more important than the basic technical 
    skills of the job.

  <h2>
    Real World Applications
  </h2>
  <p>
    The syllabus states “Keep in mind that few people do great things in computer science or data science alone. 
    Almost all great accomplishments are due to a collaborative team of people working towards common goals.” This idea is 
    one of the first things Mayuko talks about in the video, namely in the structure of her job at Patreon. She talks about how 
    as an iOS developer, in addition to writing code, she has to work with a project manager who oversees her work, reviewers 
    who double check her code, as well as her fellow developers who may provide input on certain topics. This kind of 
    collaboration will be crucial to learn as a computer science student
